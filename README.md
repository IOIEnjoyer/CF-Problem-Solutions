# Japanese Research Solutions

## Overview
This repository provides algorithmic solutions created **exclusively for research and educational purposes**.  
Each implementation is constructed to support:

- empirical investigation of problem-solving methods,
- transparent algorithmic reasoning,
- reproducible computational analysis,
- and structured documentation consistent with scientific research.

The contents reflect a disciplined, research-oriented approach to competitive programming tasks.

## Research Motivation

As an **algorithm and machine learning researcher**, I maintain this repository to build a well-organized environment for **algorithmic experimentation and evaluation**.  
AtCoder and Codeforces problems function as valuable benchmarks for analyzing:

- algorithmic complexity and performance patterns,
- optimization and data-structure choices,
- mathematical and ML-related reasoning applied to discrete problems,
- and systematic approaches to solving constrained computational tasks.

This repository serves as a **research notebook**, preserving reproducible solutions, alternative strategies, and theoretical insights for future reference.  
Its purpose is strictly **research and education**.
